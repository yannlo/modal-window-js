            <p>Bender?! You stole the atom. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! It must be wonderful. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
            <p>I was having the most   <a href="#">wonderful dream.</a> <strong> Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</strong> <em> I had more, but you go ahead.</em> I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>
            <h2>Is the Space Pope reptilian!?</h2>
            <p>Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? You don't know how to do any of those. Guess again. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>

                <li>Well, then good news! It's a suppository.</li><li>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</li><li>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</li>

            <h3>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</h3>
            <p>Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Leela's gonna kill me. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
            <ul>
            
                <li>Is that a cooking show?</li><li>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</li><li>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</li>
            
            </ul>
            <input type="text">

            <p>Say what? It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?</p>
            <p>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. I never loved you. Yeah, lots of people did. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?</p>
            <p>I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Bender, we're trying our best. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
            <p>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. So, how 'bout them Knicks? You lived before you met me?!</p>
            <p>You lived before you met me?! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.</p>
            <p>Oh, I think we should just stay friends. And I'm his friend Jesus. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</p>
            <p>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! No, just a regular mistake. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
            <p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! No argument here. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</p>
            <p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? We're rescuing ya. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</p>
            <p>Who are you, my warranty?! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Oh God, what have I done? Oh sure! Blame the wizards!</p>
            <p>Shut up and get to the point! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
